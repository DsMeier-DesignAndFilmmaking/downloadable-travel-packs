# TravelPacks V2 — Project Rules

## Vite & Config
- **NEVER** create `vite.config.js`. ALWAYS use `vite.config.ts`.
- If `vite.config.js` is found, DELETE it immediately.
- Use TypeScript for all configuration and tooling.

## Code
- Use TypeScript for all application logic. No `.js` or `.jsx` for new source files.
- Prefer `.ts` and `.tsx` extensions; ensure `tsconfig` includes all relevant paths.

## PWA
- Path-based PWA scoping is defined in `vite.config.ts` via `VitePWA` (scope, manifest, workbox).
- Do not duplicate PWA config in a separate manifest file unless required for build output.

## Data & Structure
- City and travel-survival data lives under `src/data/`. Keep types and data consistent with `cities.ts` schema.
